# eoapi-template

Template repository to deploy [eoapi](https://eoapi.dev) on AWS using the [eoapi-cdk constructs](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoapi-cdk) or locally with Docker.

## Requirements

- python >=3.9
- docker
- node >=14
- AWS credentials environment variables configured to point to an account.
- **Optional** a `config.yaml` file to override the default deployment settings defined in `config.py`.

## Installation

Install python dependencies with

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And node dependencies with

```
npm install
```

Verify that the `cdk` CLI is available. Since `aws-cdk` is installed as a local dependency, you can use the `npx` node package runner tool, that comes with `npm`.

```
npx cdk --version
```
## Deployment

First, synthesize the app

```
npx cdk synth --all
```

Then, deploy

```
npx cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
```

## Docker

Before deploying the application, you can start exploring the different services using *Docker*

```
docker compose up
```

Once the applications are *up*, you'll need to add STAC **Collections** and **Items** to the PgSTAC database. If you don't have, you can use the follow the [MAXAR open data demo](https://github.com/vincentsarago/MAXAR_opendata_to_pgstac) (or get inspired by the other [demos](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoAPI/tree/main/demo)).

Then you can start exploring your dataset with:

  - the STAC Metadata service [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
  - the Raster service [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
  - the browser UI [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085)

If you've added a vector dataset to the `public` schema in the Postgres database, they will be available through the **Vector** service at [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083).
